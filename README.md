## Description of the project

First of all, this is my first application developed in Windows Forms.\
I was not able to create the application as you prefered with levels and mock-ups that you sent and for that __I AM VERY SORRY__.\
__BUT__ I still gave a solution covering, the requests that you sent.



Because I couldn't implement game levels, I created a function that can generate some random buttons(lights) by itself.\
Buttons(lights) are switched on and off in a random way.\
You can create buttons(lights) by selecting how many rows and columns of button(lights)s do we want, and after that click on GENERATE buttons(lights).\

In the moves textbox, it is shown how many times has the user clicked to complete the game.\

After the game is complete, a message that 'You Won!' is shown in the screen.\
By clicking the OK button, the game starts again and we can generate new buttons(lights) again.\

Also we can restart the game and set its settings to default by clicking the RESTART button.
